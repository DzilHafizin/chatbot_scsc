  utter_conflict:
  - text: "This conflict of South China Sea is coming from the famous nine-dashed line that claimed by China itself. The nine-dashed
    line is a historical claim by China as their history rights. But this has been rejected as it does not comply with the international 
    law and UNCLOS. Then the rights and all claims of the maritime on the South China Sea is resolved according to the principles and 
    rules of UNCLOS. Regardless of the rights and claims, China still reluctant to accept it as they stated that their territorial 
    sovereignty, maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea are established in the long course of history."

  utter_local:
  - text: "Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the transport planes on Monday after detecting suspicious activity over the South China Sea. 
    Malaysia's foreign ministry described the manoeuvre as a serious threat to national sovereignty. China, however, said its aircraft 
    had abided by international law.Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam all contest China's claim to almost all of the 
    South China Sea. The row has rumbled on for decades but tensions have increased in recent years. Beijing continues to claim an area 
    known as the nine-dash line and has backed its claim with island-building and patrols, expanding its military presence while 
    maintaining that its intentions are peaceful."
